# falling-sand

## Summary

Upon viewing the [Coding Train's tutorial on simulating falling sand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4u7Zy_b868), I was inspired to experiment with a different approach using `bevy`, an _Entity Component System_ (ECS) framework developed in Rust.

In a nutshell, ECS is distilled into three concepts:
- Entities are objects in your game world.
- Components are data attached to entities.
- Systems are logic that runs on entities with specific components.

Please note, my expertise does not lie in `bevy` or game development in general. This project is purely a fun experiment!
